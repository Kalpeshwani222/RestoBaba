The objectives of our project is to increase the customerâ€™s dining experience by fastening
the existing restaurant services and to simplify the ordering and bill payment systems to
minimize the workload of the restaurant and hotel owners, With smartphones, the customer
can scan the QR code which is set on the table, and open the current menu to order the
food. Upon ordering, the notification will be delivered to the kitchen. The current menu and
offers will be updated on this menu. The presence of each component has been reasoned out
and placed very carefully, thus contributing to the best and efficient working of the device.
This system will help in reducing the waiting time of customers in the restaurant. It will
also reduce the manual service given by waiters and serving staff, and also eliminating the
human made mistakes.
